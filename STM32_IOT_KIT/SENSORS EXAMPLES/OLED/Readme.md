## Overview

This code allows you to display data on an OLED screen using Arduino and the Adafruit SSD1306 library. You can customize the data you want to display on the screen, including fonts and screen positioning.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- OLED display compatible with the Adafruit SSD1306 library
- Power source (3.3v)
- Ground connection

### Software

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the hardware as follows:

   - Connect the VCC of the OLED display to a 3.3v power source.
   - Connect the GND of the OLED display to the ground.
   - Connect the SDA (data) pin of the OLED display to the corresponding SDA pin on your Arduino board.
   - Connect the SCL (clock) pin of the OLED display to the corresponding SCL pin on your Arduino board.

2. Ensure that your Arduino board is properly powered.

## Software Setup

1. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

2. Make sure to select the correct Arduino board and COM port from the "Tools" menu.

3. Upload the code provided in this project to your Arduino board.

## Libraries

This project uses the following library:

- **Adafruit SSD1306**: For working with OLED displays.

You need to have the Adafruit SSD1306 library installed in your Arduino IDE for this code to work.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

2. The code will clear the OLED display, display a header, and show data on the screen with the specified format.

3. You can customize the displayed data, font size, position, and other aspects by modifying the code.

4. The OLED display will update the data as per the delay specified in the code (e.g., every 500 milliseconds).
